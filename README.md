# *hello-world*
My very first GitHub repository

** Hi, my name is Tyler Blackwater. Nice to meet you GitHub matrix version of a world! **

## Now I try other Markdown syntax
1. I'm a taurus
2. I love food
3. I hate spiders
4. EEAAO is a masterpiece

- I love
- and love
- and love
- I rarely hate
- and hate and hate

Now we test some code syntax

'python vgg16_run_model.py -s test_batchfile.csv'

-------

'a = [0]*4
b = "stringname"
c = 1.01'
